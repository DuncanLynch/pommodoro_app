# Welcome to Pomo, the ultimate eye tracking focus tool.

Pomo implments the Pomodoro focus technique by tracking the user's eye movements. If the user stares off-screen for too long, an alarm will blare to get them to focus again. 

# Running
In order to use the webapp, navigate to http://pomo.annoloom.com/ and create an account.

To use the desktop app, install all of the dependencies in the exe/ folder. (Note: Pomo is built for Python 3.11, this is the required version!) Then complete the calibration by looking at the green dots in succession, and then you can use the app!

# Welcome to Pomo, the ultimate eye tracking focus tool.

Pomo was developed for Quackhacks 2026!
Pomo implements the Pomodoro focus technique by tracking the user's eye movements. If the user stares off-screen for too long, an alarm will sound to get them to refocus. Study sessions are saved in user accounts on the website!

# Running
In order to use the webapp, navigate to http://pomo.annoloom.com/ and create an account.

To use the desktop app, install all of the dependencies in the exe/ folder. (Note: Pomo is built for Python 3.11, this is the required version!) Then complete the calibration by looking at the green dots in succession, and then you can use the app!

Here is a link to our demo:

Pomo is in the mindfulness track, and we hosted the app on DigitalOcean.
